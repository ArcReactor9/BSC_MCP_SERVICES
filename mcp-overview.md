# BSC MCP Server Overview

The BSC MCP Server is a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation designed to provide Large Language Models (LLMs) with direct access to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) blockchain data and functionality.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Blockchain Data**: Access current block information, transaction details, and account balances directly from the BSC network.
- **Token Management**: Check BEP-20 token balances and create new Four.meme tokens with customizable parameters.
- **Flexible Integration**: Connect via both STDIO for direct LLM integration and HTTP/SSE for web applications.
- **Developer Friendly**: Well-documented API with complete examples and clear error messaging.

## Use Cases

- **Blockchain Data Analysis**: Allow LLMs to analyze and interpret real-time blockchain data for insights.
- **Wallet Monitoring**: Check balances and transaction history for BSC addresses.
- **Token Creation**: Deploy custom Four.meme tokens without requiring deep blockchain development knowledge.
- **DeFi Interactions**: Enable LLMs to query and interact with decentralized finance protocols on BSC.

## Technical Implementation

This server is built using Node.js and TypeScript, leveraging ethers.js for blockchain interactions. It implements the Model Context Protocol specification, making it compatible with various LLM clients supporting the MCP standard.
